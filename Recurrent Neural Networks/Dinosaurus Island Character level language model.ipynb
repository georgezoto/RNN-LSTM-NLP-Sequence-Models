Recall that your overall loop structure usually consists of a forward pass, a cost computation, a backward pass, and a parameter update. Before updating the parameters, you will perform gradient clipping when needed to make sure that your gradients are not \"exploding,\" meaning taking on overly large values. \n",

There are different ways to clip gradients; we will use a simple element-wise clipping procedure, in which every element of the gradient vector is clipped to lie between some range [-N, N]. More generally, you will provide a `maxValue` (say 10). In this example, if any component of the gradient vector is greater than 10, it would be set to 10; and if any component of the gradient vector is less than -10, it would be set to -10. If it is between -10 and 10, it is left alone. \n",

        "**Exercise**: Implement the `sample` function below to sample characters. You need to carry out 4 steps:\n",

We have provided a `softmax()` function that you can use.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Step 3**: Carry out sampling: Pick the next character's index according to the probability distribution specified by $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t+1 \\rangle }$. This means that if $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t+1 \\rangle }_i = 0.16$, you will pick the index \"i\" with 16% probability. To implement it, you can use [`np.random.choice`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an example of how to use `np.random.choice()`:\n",

        "np.random.seed(0)\n",
        "p = np.array([0.1, 0.0, 0.7, 0.2])\n",
        "index = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3], p = p.ravel())\n",
        "```\n",
        "This means that you will pick the `index` according to the distribution: \n",
        "$P(index = 0) = 0.1, P(index = 1) = 0.0, P(index = 2) = 0.7, P(index = 3) = 0.2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Step 4**: The last step to implement in `sample()` is to overwrite the variable `x`, which currently stores $x^{\\langle t \\rangle }$, with the value of $x^{\\langle t + 1 \\rangle }$. You will represent $x^{\\langle t + 1 \\rangle }$ by creating a one-hot vector corresponding to the character you've chosen as your prediction. You will then forward propagate $x^{\\langle t + 1 \\rangle }$ in Step 1 and keep repeating the process until you get a \"\\n\" character, indicating you've reached the end of the dinosaur name. "

At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end you could see dinosaur names with cool endings. Feel free to run the algorithm even longer and play with hyperparameters to see if you can get even better results. Our implemetation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. Your model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "If your model generates some non-cool names, don't blame the model entirely--not all actual dinosaur names sound cool. (For example, `dromaeosauroides` is an actual dinosaur name and is in the training set.) But this model should give you a set of candidates from which you can pick the coolest! \n",

        "This assignment had used a relatively small dataset, so that you could train an RNN quickly on a CPU. Training a model of the english language requires a much bigger dataset, and usually needs much more computation, and could run for many hours on GPUs. We ran our dinosaur name for quite some time, and so far our favoriate name is the great, undefeatable, and fierce: Mangosaurus!\n",
